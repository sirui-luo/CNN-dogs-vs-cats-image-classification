# CNN-dogs-vs-cats-image-classification
#### Project Description
In this Cat VS Dog image classification project, I used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image binary classification to distinguish between dogs and cats. Built with deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras, it showcases techniques in image processing and applying CNNs to binary classification problems.
