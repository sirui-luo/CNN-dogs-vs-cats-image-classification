# CNN-dogs-vs-cats-image-classification
#### Project Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model that accurately classifies images as either cats or dogs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project aims to:
* Apply image preprocessing techniques to prepare raw image data for training.
* Design and train a CNN model and evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on binary classification tasks.
* Demonstrate practical application of deep learning in computer vision.

#### Project Method
In this Cat VS Dog image classification project, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is used for image binary classification to distinguish between dogs and cats. Built with deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras, it showcases techniques in image processing and applying CNNs to binary classification problems.
